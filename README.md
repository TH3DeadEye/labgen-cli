# labgen-cli
A simple CLI tool to auto-generate boilerplate HTML and JS files for your programming labs. Save time, stay organized, and never start your COMP1235 lab from scratch again.

## Features

- Generate `.html`, `.js`, or any other file type with a single command.
- Creates a ready-to-use HTML template with a linked JS script.
- Checks if files already exist to prevent accidental overwriting.
- Flexible and easy to useâ€”works for any file name or file type.

## Installation

Clone this repository and make the script executable:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TH3DeadEye/labgen-cli.git
cd labgen-cli
chmod +x index.js
````

(Optional) To use it globally:

```bash
sudo cp index.js /usr/local/bin/labgen
```

## Usage

In your project directory, run:

```bash
./labgen-cli.js lab9_closure js html
```

or, if installed globally:

```bash
labgen lab9_closure js html
```

This will create `lab9_closure.js` and `lab9_closure.html` with starter content.

## Example Output

**lab9\_closure.html**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

    <meta charset="UTF-8">
